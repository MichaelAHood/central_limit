# central_limit
This is a workbook where I play around with the relationship between the CLT and a Guassian shaped curve.

I start by simulating a coin toss for a certain number of trials and then count the proportion of tosses that were heads.

Then, I repeat the same experiment a ridiculous number of times, plot the results in a histogram, and repeat until I
end up with something that begins to look like a bell curve.
